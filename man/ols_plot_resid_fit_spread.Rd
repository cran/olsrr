\usage{
ols_plot_resid_fit_spread(model, print_plot = TRUE)

ols_plot_fm(model, print_plot = TRUE)

ols_plot_resid_spread(model, print_plot = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{An object of class \code{lm}.}

\item{print_plot}{logical; if \code{TRUE}, prints the plot else returns a plot object.}

\description{
Plot to detect non-linearity, influential observations and outliers.
}
\details{
Consists of side-by-side quantile plots of the centered fit and the
residuals. It shows how much variation in the data is explained by the fit
and how much remains in the residuals. For inappropriate models, the spread
of the residuals in such a plot is often greater than the spread of the
centered fit.

\section{Deprecated Function}{

\code{ols_rfs_plot()}, \code{ols_fm_plot()} and \code{ols_rsd_plot()}
  has been deprecated. Instead use \code{ols_plot_resid_fit_spread()},
  \code{ols_plot_fm()} and \code{ols_plot_resid_spread()}.
